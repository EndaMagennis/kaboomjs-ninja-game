## Background to Jump Ninja Jump

I have loved playing games for most of my life and in recent years have begun learning game development as a hobby. Jump Ninja Jump, or JNJ, is an opportunity to merge my passion for game development with my course through a JavaScript library called [Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/). The original concept for JNJ was to scale a map and collect a maguffin, but as I grew more familiar with the [Kaboomjs](https://kaboomjs.com/) library, the scope and complexity increased. It is still, by all accounts, a simple game, but the game now encorporates enemys and combat.
